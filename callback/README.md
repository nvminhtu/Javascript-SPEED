# NOTE ABOUT CALLBACK

## What is a Callback?

* Simply put: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.

* More complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.

* Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.

# Why Callback?

* For one very important reason — JavaScript is an event driven language. This means that instead of waiting for a response before moving on, JavaScript will keep executing while listening for other event

# Where Callback?

* Everywhere you want to use in your code - must avoid `Callback hell`

# When Callback?

* You can’t just call one function after another and hope they execute in the right order. Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.
=> so this time we can call Callback
